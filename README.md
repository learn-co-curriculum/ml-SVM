Implement linear classifier with a support vector machine
- Visual example:
    - Classify as 0/1 by using a hyperplane, a line that splits the input variable space
    - 2D and 3D examples + mathematical expressions in terms of coefficients and input variables
- Concept of “margin” and maximal-margin classifier
- Extension to the linear classifier: soft-margin classifier 

Implement non-linear classifier with a support vector machine (part I)
- Why do you want a non-linear classifier? 
     - Visual example: show a 2D example that shows linear discrimination is insufficient
     - Show that by projecting this problem to a 3D space you might be able to solve the problem
           - Motivation to use kernel methods
           - For 2D -> 3D rotation, use mplot3d from mpl_toolkit for interactive visualization.
